A string is an isogram if no letter in that string appears more than once. Examples:  Attention reader! Don?t stop learning now.

Input: arr[] = {?abcd?, ?derg?, ?erty?}Output: 3Explanation: All given strings are isograms. In all the strings no character&nbsp;is present more than once. Hence count is 3       Input: arr[] = {?agka?, ?lkmn?}Output: 1Explanation: Only string ?lkmn? is isogram. In the string ?agka?&nbsp;the character ?a? is present twice. Hence count is 1.   &nbsp;  Approach: Greedy approach can be used for solving this problem. Traverse each string in the given string array and check if that is isogram or not. To do that follow the steps mentioned below:  Traverse the array of string and follow the below steps for each string: Create a frequency map of characters. Wherever any character has a frequency greater than 1, skip the current string and move to the next one. If no character has frequency more than 1, increment the count of answer by 1. Return the count stored in answer when all the strings are traversed.  Below is the implementation of the above approach:  C++                          #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;   using namespace std;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Function to check   // if a string is an isogram   bool isIsogram(string s)   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Loop to check   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // if string is isogram or not   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vector&lt; int &gt; freq(26, 0);   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ( char c : s) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freq++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (freq &gt; 1) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return false ;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return true ;   }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Function to count the number of isograms   int countIsograms(vector&lt;string&gt;&amp; arr)   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int ans = 0;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Loop to iterate the string array   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (string x : arr) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (isIsogram(x)) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ans++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return ans;   }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Driver Code   int main()   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vector&lt;string&gt; arr = {  &quot;abcd&quot; ,  &quot;derg&quot; ,  &quot;erty&quot; };   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Count of isograms in string array arr[]   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; countIsograms(arr) &lt;&lt; endl;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 0;   }                       Output 3  Time Complexity: O(N*M), where N is the size of the array and M is the size of the longest stringAuxiliary Space: O(1)          My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up      Save           Like      Previous  Count of isogram strings in given array of strings with length at least K    Next   Length of longest subarray having sum in given range [L, R]          Recommended Articles     Page :             Count of isogram strings in given array of strings with length at least K   26, Nov 21       Check if a string is Isogram or not   27, Jun 17       Count of binary strings of length N having equal count of 0's and 1's and count of 1's ? count of 0's in each prefix substring   25, Jul 20       Count new pairs of strings that can be obtained by swapping first characters of pairs of strings from given array   14, Apr 21           Count of same length Strings that exists lexicographically in between two given Strings   03, Apr 20       Count of distinct Strings possible by swapping prefixes of pairs of Strings from the Array   18, Aug 20       Count strings from given array having all characters appearing in a given string   17, Dec 20       Search strings with the help of given pattern in an Array of strings   18, Aug 20           Print all Strings from array A[] having all strings from array B[] as subsequence   16, Jul 20       Count of strings that become equal to one of the two strings after one removal   14, Jan 19       Minimize count of given operations required to make two given strings permutations of each other   23, Sep 20       Count of Superstrings in a given array of strings   16, Jun 21           Count of strings in the first array which are smaller than every string in the second array   05, Jul 19       Count of pairs {X, Y} from an array such that sum of count of set bits in X ?
