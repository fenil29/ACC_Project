Input: Tree in the below imageOutput: 4Explanation: The nodes {10, 3, 2, 4} have the distance between them and all the leaf nodes in their subtree respectively as equal.        Input: Tree in the image belowOutput: 3    &nbsp;  Approach: The given problem can be solved by using the post-order traversal. The idea is to check if the number of nodes from the current node to all its leaf nodes is the same. Below steps can be followed to solve the problem:  Apply&nbsp;post-order traversal on the N-ary tree:  If the root has no children then return 1 to the parent If every branch has equal height then increment the count by 1 and return height + 1 to the parent Or else return -1 to the parent indicating that the branches have unequal height  Return the count as the answer   Java                          // Java implementation for the above approach   &nbsp;&nbsp;
