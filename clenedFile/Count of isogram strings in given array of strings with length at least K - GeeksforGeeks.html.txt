Input: arr[] = {?abcd?, ?der?, ?erty?}, K = 4Output: 2Explanation: All given strings are isograms, but only ?abcd? and ?erty? are of length at least K. Hence count is 2       Input: arr[] = {?ag?, ?bka?, ?lkmn?, ?asdfg?}, K = 2Output: 4Explanation: All the strings are isograms and each strings is of length &gt;=K. Hence count is 4.   Approach: This problem can be solved by storing frequencies of all the characters or by using a Set data structure. A string is an isogram if no letter in that string appears more than once. Follow the steps below to solve the given problem.&nbsp;  Traverse the array of strings arr[], and for each string Create a frequency map of characters. Wherever any character has a frequency greater than 1, or if the length of the string is less than K, skip the current string. Otherwise, if no character has a frequency more than 1, and if the length of the string is less than K, increment the count of the answer. Print the count stored in the answer when all the strings are traversed.  Below is the implementation of the above approach.  C++                          // C++ code for the above approach   #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;   using namespace std;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Function to check if a string   // is an isogram or not   bool isIsogram(string s)   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // To store the frequencies   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vector&lt; int &gt; freq(26, 0);   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ( char c : s) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freq++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (freq &gt; 1) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return false ;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return true ;   }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Function to check if array arr contains   // all isograms or not   int allIsograms(vector&lt;string&gt;&amp; arr,  int K)   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int ans = 0;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (string x : arr) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (isIsogram(x) &amp;&amp; x.length() &gt;= K) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ans++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return ans;   }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Driver Code   int main()   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vector&lt;string&gt; arr = {  &quot;abcd&quot; ,  &quot;der&quot; ,  &quot;erty&quot; };   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int K = 4;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Function call and printing the answer   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; allIsograms(arr, K);   }                       Output 2  Time Complexity: O(N*M), where N is the size of the array and M is the size of the longest string.
