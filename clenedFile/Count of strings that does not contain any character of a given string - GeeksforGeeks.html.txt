Input: arr[] = {?abcd?, ?hijk?, ?xyz?, ?ayt?}, str=?apple?Output: 2Explanation: ?hijk? and ?xyz? are the strings that do not contain any character of str       Input: arr[] = {?apple?, ?banana?, ?pear?}, str=?nil?Output: 1   Approach: Follow the below steps to solve this problem:  Create a set st and store each character of string str in this set. Create a variable ans to store the number of all the required strings. Now, start traversing on the array and for each string, check if any of its character is present in the set st or not. If it is, then this is not a required string. If it doesn?t contain any character from the set, increase answer by 1. Return ans after the loop ends, as the answer to this problem.  Below is the implementation of the above approach:  C++                          // C++ code for the above approach   &nbsp;&nbsp;   #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;   using namespace std;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Function to count the number of strings   // that does not contain any character of string str   int allowedStrings(vector&lt;string&gt;&amp; arr, string str)   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int ans = 0;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unordered_set&lt; char &gt; st;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ( auto x : str) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; st.insert(x);   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ( auto x : arr) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bool allowed = 1;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ( auto y : x) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // If the character is present in st   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (st.find(y) != st.end()) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; allowed = 0;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; break ;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // If the string doesn't   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // have any character of st   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (allowed) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ans += 1;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return ans;   }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Driver Code   int main()   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vector&lt;string&gt; arr   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = {  &quot;abcd&quot; ,  &quot;hijk&quot;
