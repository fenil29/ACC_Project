Input: arr[] = { ?abab?, ?derdee?, ?erre? }, K = 2Output: 2Explanation: Strings with character frequency at most 2 are ?abab?, ?erre?. Hence count is 2       Input: arr[] = {?ag?, ?ka?, ?nanana?}, K = 3&nbsp;Output: 1   Approach: The idea is to traverse the array of strings, and for each string create a frequency map of characters. Wherever any character has a frequency greater than K, skip the current string. Otherwise, if no character has a frequency more than K, increment the count of answer. Print the count stored in the answer when all the strings are traversed. Follow the steps below to solve the problem:  Define a function isDuogram(string s, int K) and perform the following tasks:  Initialize the vector freq[26] with values 0. Traverse over the string s using the variable c and perform the following tasks:  Increase the count of freq by 1.  Iterate over the range [0. 26) using the variable i and perform the following tasks:  If freq[i] is greater than K then return false.  After performing the above steps, return true as the answer.  Initialize the variable ans as 0 to store the answer. Traverse over the array arr[] using the variable x and perform the following tasks:  Call the function isDuogram(x, K) and if the function returns true then increase the count of ans by 1.  After performing the above steps, print the value of ans as the answer.  Below is the implementation of the above approach:  C++                          // C++ program for the above approach   #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;   using namespace std;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Function to check if a string   // is an duogram or not   bool isDuogram(string s,  int K)   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Array to store the frequency   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // of characters   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vector&lt; int &gt; freq(26, 0);   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Count the frequency   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ( char c : s) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; freq++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Cjeck if the frequency is greater   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // than K or not   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 26; i++)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (freq[i] &gt; K)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return false ;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return true ;   }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Function to check if array arr contains   // all duograms or not   int countDuograms(vector&lt;string&gt;&amp; arr,  int K)   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Store the answer   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int ans = 0;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Traverse the strings   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (string x : arr) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Check the condition   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (isDuogram(x, K)) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ans++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return ans;   }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Driver Code   int main()   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vector&lt;string&gt; arr = {  &quot;abab&quot; ,  &quot;derdee&quot; ,  &quot;erre&quot; };   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int K = 2;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; countDuograms(arr, K);
