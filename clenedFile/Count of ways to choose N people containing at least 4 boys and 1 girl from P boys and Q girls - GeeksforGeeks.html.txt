Input:&nbsp; P = 5, Q = 2, N = 5Output: 10Explanation: &nbsp;Suppose given pool is {m1, m2, m3, m4, m5} and {w1, w2}. Then possible combinations are:&nbsp;       m1 m2 m3 m4 w1m2 m3 m4 m5 w1m1 m3 m4 m5 w1m1 m2 m4 m5 w1m1 m2 m3 m5 w1m1 m2 m3 m4 w2m2 m3 m4 m5 w2m1 m3 m4 m5 w2m1 m2 m4 m5 w2m1 m2 m3 m5 w2 Hence the count is 10. Input: &nbsp;P = 5, Q = 2, N = 6Output: 7   &nbsp;  Approach: This problem is based on combinatorics where we need to select at least 4 boys out of 1 boys available, and at least Y girls out of Q girls available, so that total people selected are N.Consider the example:  &nbsp;P = 5, Q = 2, N = 6&nbsp;In this, the possible selections are:(4 boys out of 5) * (2 girls out of 2) + (5 boys out of 5) * (1 girl out of 2)= 5C4 * 2C2 + 5C5 * 2C1  So for some general values of P, Q and N, the approach can be visualised as: &nbsp;where&nbsp; Follow the steps mentioned below to implementation it:  Start iterating a loop from i = 4 till i = P. At each iteration calculate the number of possible ways if we choose i boys and (N-i) girls, using combination&nbsp; Add the possible value for each iteration as the total number of ways. Return the total calculated ways at the end.  Below is the implementation of the approach:  C++                          #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;   using namespace std;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Function to calculate factorial   long long int fact( int f)   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long long int ans = 1;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Loop to calculate factorial of f   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (--f &gt; 0)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ans = ans * f;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return ans;   }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Function to calculate combinaion nCr   long long int ncr( int n,  int r)   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return (fact(n) / (fact(r) * fact(n - r)));   }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Function to calculate the number of ways   long long int countWays( int n,  int p,  int q)   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long long int sum = 0;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Loop to calculate the number of ways   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ( long long int i = 4; i &lt;= p; i++) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (n - i &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; n - i &lt;= q)   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sum += (ncr(p, i) * ncr(q, n - i));   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return sum;   }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Driver code   int main()   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int P = 5, Q = 2, N = 5;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cout &lt;&lt; countWays(N, P, Q) &lt;&lt; endl;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return 0;   }                       Output 10   Time Complexity: O(N2)Auxiliary Space: O(1)          My Personal Notes arrow_drop_up      Save           Like      Previous  Count of ways to convert 2 into N by squaring, adding 1 or multiplying with 2    Next   Count of strings with frequency of each character at most X and length at least Y          Recommended Articles     Page :             Place N boys and M girls in different rows such that count of persons placed in each row is maximized   10, Mar 21       Seating arrangement of n boys and girls alternatively around a round table   29, Oct 18       Seating arrangement of N boys sitting around a round table such that two particular boys sit together   20, Jun 19       Number of ways to choose a pair containing an even and an odd number from 1 to N   25, Oct 18           Ways to choose balls such that at least one ball is chosen   03, Sep 19       Count ways to distribute m items among n people   16, Sep 18       Count of ways to distribute N items among 3 people with one person receiving maximum   30, Jun 20       Count of ways to choose K elements from given Array with maximum sum   22, Jul 21           Number of ways to pair people   05, Mar 19       Distributed C candies among N boys such that difference between maximum and minimum candies received is K   08, Apr 21       Count pairs in an array containing at least one even value   20, Jun 20       Count of 3 length strings using given characters containing at least 2 different characters   27, Oct 21           Count of substrings from given Ternary strings containing characters at least once   29, Sep 21       Number of ways to choose K intersecting line segments on X-axis   21, May 20       Count of ways to form 2 necklace from N beads containing N/2 beads each   05, Jul 21       Count of ways N elements can form two different sets containing N/2 elements each   17, Nov 21           Arithmetic Progression containing X and Y with least possible first term   14, Sep 20       Count of groups among N people having only one leader in each group   30, Jun 20       Minimize length of Substrings containing at least one common Character   27, Jul 20       Check if N can be represented as sum of positive integers containing digit D at least once   11, May 21           Minimum and Maximum number of pairs in m teams of n people   08, Dec 18       Find the positions of given people after T time using their starting time and direction   27, Sep 21       Find if two people ever meet after same number of jumps   16, Sep 17       Check if two people starting from different points ever meet   08, May 18                Article Contributed By :         Code_r   @Code_r        Vote for difficulty    Easy Normal Medium Hard Expert         Article Tags :   Combinatorial Mathematical     Practice Tags :   Mathematical Combinatorial       Report Issue        Writing code in comment?
