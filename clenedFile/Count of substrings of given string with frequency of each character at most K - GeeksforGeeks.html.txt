Input: str = ?abab?, K = 1Output: 7Explanation: The substrings such that the frequency of each character is atmost 1 are ?a?, ?b?, ?a?, ?b?, ?ab?, ?ba? and ?ab?.       Input: str[] = ?xxyyzzxx?, K = 2Output: 33   &nbsp;  Approach: The given problem can be solved using the two-pointer technique. Iterate through each character of the string in the range [0, N) and maintain the frequency of each character in an unordered map. Create a variable ptr, which stores the index of the starting point of the current window. Initially, the value of ptr is 0. For index i, if the frequency of str[i] is less than or equal to K, add (i ? ptr + 1) into the substring count, otherwise, increment the value of ptr until str[i] &gt; K.&nbsp; Below is the implementation of the above approach:  C++                          // C++ program for the above approach   #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;   using namespace std;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Function to find the count of   // substrings such that frequency   // of each character is atmost K   int cntSubstr(string str,  int K)   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Stores the size of string   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int N = str.size();   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Stores the final count   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int ans = 0;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Stores the starting index   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int ptr = 0;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Stores the frequency of   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // characters of string   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unordered_map&lt; char ,  int &gt; m;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Loop to iterate through string   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for ( int i = 0; i &lt; N; i++) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Increment the frequency of   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // the current character   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m[str[i]]++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // While the frequency of char is   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // greater than K, increment ptr   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (m[str[i]] &gt; K &amp;&amp; ptr &lt;= i) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m[str[ptr]]--;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ptr++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Update count   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ans += (i - ptr + 1);   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Return Answer   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return ans;   }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Driver Code   int main()   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; string str =  &quot;abab&quot; ;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
