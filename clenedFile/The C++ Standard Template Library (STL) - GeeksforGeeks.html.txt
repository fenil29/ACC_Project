It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL. STL has four components   Want to learn from the best curated videos and practice problems, check out the C++ Foundation Course for Basic to Advanced C++ and C++ STL Course for foundation plus STL.&nbsp; To complete your preparation from learning a language to DS Algo and many more,&nbsp; please refer Complete Interview Preparation Course .    Algorithms Containers Functions Iterators  Algorithms The header algorithm defines a collection of functions especially designed to be used on ranges of elements.They act on containers and provide means for various operations for the contents of the containers.        Algorithm  Sorting Searching Important STL Algorithms Useful Array algorithms Partition Operations  Numeric  valarray class   Containers Containers or container classes store objects and data. There are in total seven standard ?first-class? container classes and three container adaptor classes and only seven header files that provide access to these containers or container adaptors.  Sequence Containers: implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner.  vector list deque arrays forward_list( Introduced in C++11)  Container Adaptors : provide a different interface for sequential containers.  queue priority_queue stack  Associative Containers : implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).  set multiset map multimap  Unordered Associative Containers : implement unordered data structures that can be quickly searched  unordered_set (Introduced in C++11) unordered_multiset (Introduced in C++11) unordered_map (Introduced in C++11) unordered_multimap (Introduced in C++11)    Flowchart of Adaptive Containers and Unordered Containers    Flowchart of Sequence conatiners and ordered containers   Functions The STL includes classes that overload the function call operator. Instances of such classes are called function objects or functors. Functors allow the working of the associated function to be customized with the help of parameters to be passed.  Functors  Iterators As the name suggests, iterators are used for working upon a sequence of values. They are the major feature that allow generality in STL.  Iterators  Utility Library Defined in header &lt;utility&gt;.  pair   To master C++ Standard Template Library (STL) in the most efficient and effective way, do check out this C++ STL Online Course by GeeksforGeeks. The course covers the basics of C++ and in-depth explanations to all C++ STL containers, iterators, etc along with video explanations of a few problems. Also, you?ll learn to use STL inbuilt classes and functions in order to implement some of the complex data structures and perform operations on them conveniently.
