Input: arr[] = {1, 4, 6}, L = 3, R = 8Output: 2Explanation: The valid subarrays with there sum in range [3, 8] are {1, 4}, {4}, {6}. Longest subarray among them is {1, 4} having its length as 2.       Input: arr[] = {15, 2, 4, 8, 9, 5, 10, 23}, L = 10, R = 23Output: 4   Approach: The given problem can be solved using the sliding window technique. Initially, create a window from the starting elements of the array such that its sum is greater than L. Maintain two variables i and j representing the starting and the ending index of the current window. If the sum of the current window is more than R, increment the value of i and if the sum is less than L, increment the value of j. For the windows with their sum in the range [L, R], maintain their maximum length in a variable len, which is the required answer.&nbsp; Below is the implementation of the above approach:  C++                          // C++ program of the above approach   #include &lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt;   using namespace std;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   // Function to find the length of   // the longest subarray having its   // sum in the given range [L, R]   int largestSubArraySum( int arr[],  int N,   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int L,  int R)   {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Store sum of current window   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int sum = 0;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Stroes indices of current window   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int i = 0, j = 0;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Stores the maximum length   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int len = 0;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Calcuating initial window   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (sum &lt; L &amp;&amp; j &lt; N) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sum += arr[j];   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Loop to iterate over all windows   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // of having sum in range [L, R]   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while (i &lt; N &amp;&amp; j &lt; N) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // If sum of window is less than L   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (sum &lt; L) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sum += arr[j];   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // If sum of window is more than R   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else if (sum &gt; R) {   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sum -= arr[i];   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // If sum is in the range [L, R]   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; else {   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // Update length   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; len = max(len, j - i);   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sum += arr[j];   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j++;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
